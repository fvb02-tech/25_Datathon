    "recommendation": "HOLD",
    "explanation": "This Japanese AI promotion regulation has minimal direct impact on AbbVie given its Americas-centric operations (76.4%). While AI advancement could modestly benefit pharmaceutical R&D processes, the regulation's unspecified requirements and AbbVie's limited Japan exposure result in a near-neutral impact with low confidence due to regulatory ambiguity.",

    "explanation": "This Japanese AI promotion regulation has minimal material impact on Abbott given its small Japan revenue exposure. While the law may create modest opportunities for AI-enhanced healthcare products and diagnostics in the Japanese market, the lack of specified requirements, penalties, and effective dates limits actionable strategic implications.

    "recommendation": "HOLD",
    "explanation": "This Japanese AI promotion regulation appears designed to encourage AI development rather than impose restrictive requirements. With Japan representing only a portion of Agilent's 33.3% Rest of Asia revenue and the law promoting rather than restricting AI use, the impact is likely neutral to slightly positive. The company's life sciences and diagnostics business could benefit modestly from increased AI adoption in Japanese research institutions and laboratories.",
